This is an enhancement of the project [ComfyUI Dwpose TensorRT](https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Dwpose-Tensorrt) by giving control and output options. Check original project for the super fast performance.

**Note: This is for tensorrt only, which is only working if you have cuda based Nvidia card**

## Features

- Giving the detecting threshold option
    <p align="center">
      <img src="assets/estimator_example_2.png" />
    </p>
- Giving output canvas resolution adjustment 
    - It will keep original picture's ratio
    - Minimum requirement for resolution\_x >= 64px, for value < 64, the output pose image will be 512px
- Giving the plot control options for body pose, face and hands 
    - The default marker size value is optimized for 1024px pictures, for smaller size picture, lower the marker size value, otherwise increase the marker size value
- Giving output options of pose keypoints and json string formats for further using, check my [ultimate-openpose-editor](https://github.com/westNeighbor/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-editor) if you need editting the pose 

## Installation

- Navigate to the ComfyUI `/custom_nodes` directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/westNeighbor/ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-estimator
cd ./ComfyUI-ultimate-openpose-estimator
pip install -r requirements.txt # if you use portable version, see below
```
if you use portable version, install requirement accordingly, for example, I have portable in my E: disk
```bash
E:/ComfyUI_windows_portable/python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Restart ComfyUI

## Building Tensorrt Engine

1. Download the following onnx models:
   - [dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx](https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/resolve/main/dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx)
   - [yolox_l.onnx](https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/resolve/main/yolox_l.onnx)
2. Build tensorrt engines for both of these models by running:

   - `python export_trt.py`

3. Place the exported engines inside ComfyUI `/models/tensorrt/dwpose` directory

## Usage

- Insert node by `Right Click -> ultimate-openpose -> Opnepose Estimator Node`
